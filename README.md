# Arabica Coffee Leaf Disease Detection Using Deep Learning 
This repository is aimed at using published Arabica coffee leaf images dataset  for coffee leaf disease detection. This work is part of Data Science Africa (DSA) 2023 conference data science hackathon resolution, where participants were to come up with their own data science problem in Africa and solve it using African dataset. In this work, we are using published coffee leaft diseased and healthy datasets from Kenya.

## Introduction
Arabica, the most commonly consumed species of coffee.In Africa  Ethiopia, Uganda,Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda are among coffee proucers in the world. Early detection of coffee diseases in  is crucial to prevent losses and enhance the productivity and quality of coffee plantations. Among these diseases, Coffee Leaf Rust, caused by the Hemileia vastatrix fungus, and Cercospora, also referred to as Brown Eye Spot and caused by the Cercospora coffeicola fungus, stand out as major threats that demand early detection. Additionally, other significant diseases include minor coffee diseases and Phoma, emphasizing the critical need for timely identification.This work seeks to employ deep learning techniques for the identification of primary diseases affecting arabica coffee leaves, aiming to develop an mobile app system that can aid coffee producers in diagnosing these diseases at early stages.

## Objectives
1. Develop CNN  model to detect the Miner, Phoma, Cescospora and Rust coffee diseases.
2. Deploy the model to mobile App
3. 2. Use real world coffee datasets to validate and fine tune the model
## Data
The dataset used in this study was obtained from previously published dataset ![link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340921004261). The coffee images from the published dataset were taken from  Kirinyaga count in Kenya.
